# LinkedIn profile badge

This is a tiny web app that puts a badged on your profile picture consistent with LinkedIn style but with your prefered text and colors.

ðŸ‘‰[**See it live**](https://badge.alexewerlof.com/)

## Why?

The profile picture is the first piece of information that people see.

LinkedIn currently (as of early 2024) only allows `#HIRED` and `#OPENTOWORK` in predefined colors.
There are [some claims](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/31/dont-use-linkedins-open-to-work-sign-says-former-google-recruiter.html)
that it hurts the job applicants to use the `#OPENTOWORK` badge.

Regardless of your opinion on the matter, the badge is a great place to spice up your online presence.

## How does it work?

- Upload a profile picture. The image stays in your browser. This app doesn't have any backend.
- The image should be have a square ratio. We recommend `500px` width and `500px` height.
- Tweak the settings to your liking.
- Download the image
- Go to your LinkedIn profile and [update your image](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a541850/add-change-edit-or-delete-your-linkedin-profile-photo)

## No, I mean how does it really work?

This is a very simple application using vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks).

* The trick is to use a `<svg>` that overlays the image file in a hidden `<canvas>` element.
* Upon tweaking the attibutes a simple JavaScript function updates the relevant element in `<svg>`.
* The code is quick and dirty and I got a bit of help from [Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) too.
* The `<canvas>` is normally hidden (you can make it visible by commenting out the `display: none` in the CSS).
* Upon change of any property, the `<canvas>` is updated.
* Upon download, the contents of the `<canvas>` is converted to `image/png`, put in a the `href` attribute of a `<link>` which is then programmatically clicked

# How can I support you?

This app took about 5 hours to develop and test.
I addressed [my own needs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexewerlof/) via [inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) but I thought this is too good (and probably useful for job seekers) to keep it to myself. So I made this app to streamline the workflow without the need to install anything on your machine or having to learn any graphic design app.

# I have ideas or suggestions

Please fork the repo and do whatever you like as long as it complies with the [license](LICENSE).

This is not my main engagement and unless there's a serious bug in it, I don't intend to touch it.
